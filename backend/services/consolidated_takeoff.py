"""
Enterprise-ready consolidated takeoff wrapper.

This module delegates consolidated takeoff requests to the underlying
``backend.backend.services.consolidated_takeoff`` implementation.  It
extracts a project identifier and query from the incoming message and
returns a structured response.  Exceptions are caught and logged.
