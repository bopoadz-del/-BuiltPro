"""
Enterprise-ready analytics engine wrapper.

This module handles requests to the analytics engine by extracting the
project identifier and query from the incoming message and delegating
processing to the underlying analytics service defined in
``backend.backend.services.analytics_service``.  It returns a structured
response containing the service name and result.  Any exceptions are
logged and a generic error message is returned to the caller.
